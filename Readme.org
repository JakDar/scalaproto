#+TITLE: Readme

Scalaproto is a simple cli allowing conversions between scala and protobuf (proto2) formats.
It can be integrated nicely with editors (e.g. vim / Emacs).

* Functionality Improvements
1. New ASTs
   - [ ] PostgreSQL create table ([[https://chriscoffey.github.io/programming/parsing-sql-ddl-schema/][this]] might help)
2. Scala Type support
   - [ ] Scala tuple => Entry class
3. Docs/UI
   - [ ] Document Emacs usage (add scalaproto.el?)
   - [ ] Add a proper CLI
4. Support Proto2 language features
   - [ ] map field (add map to common?)
   - [ ] reserved?
5. Usability improvements
   - [ ] improve error handling
* Technical improvements
- [ ] Make code more scala3-like ([[https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/new-in-scala3.html][features]])
- [ ] Experiment with [[https://github.com/disneystreaming/weaver-test][weaver-test]]?
* Ideas
-  Can scalaproto be replaced by [[https://github.com/tree-sitter][tree-sitter]]?

    I could be rewritten in rust.
